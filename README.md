# 📚 Library Management System (Design-Based Project)

## 🌟 Overview

A comprehensive **design-based Library Management System (LMS)** developed as a **Software Engineering Project**.  
This project emphasizes **conceptual modeling and architectural planning** rather than coding. It uses software engineering methodologies such as:

- UML diagrams  
- Use case modeling  
- ERDs  
- DFDs  
- System design documentation
